mzMLb
-----

mzMLb is an HDF5 container format wrapping around the standard rich XML-format
for raw mass spectrometry data storage, mzML. Please refer to [1]_ for more information
about mzMLb and its features.

This module's goal is to provide an identical interface to :mod:`psims.mzml` for writing
the same content.
